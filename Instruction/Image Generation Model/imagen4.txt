About
Generate images using Google's Imagen 4 model.

Imagen 4 is designed to generate high-quality images with enhanced detail, richer lighting, and fewer artifacts. The model excels at:

Capturing fine details and textures
Rendering diverse art styles from photorealism to animation
Understanding natural language prompts
Maintaining high visual quality and composition
1. Calling the API
#
Install the client
#
The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.

npmyarnpnpmbun

npm install --save @fal-ai/client
Migrate to @fal-ai/client
The @fal-ai/serverless-client package has been deprecated in favor of @fal-ai/client. Please check the migration guide for more information.

Setup your API Key
#
Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.


export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Submit a request
#
The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the request status updates and return the result when the request is completed.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/imagen4/preview", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Capture an intimate close-up bathed in warm, soft, late-afternoon sunlight filtering into a quintessential 1960s kitchen. The focal point is a charmingly designed vintage package of all-purpose flour, resting invitingly on a speckled Formica countertop. The packaging itself evokes pure nostalgia: perhaps thick, slightly textured paper in a warm cream tone, adorned with simple, bold typography (a friendly serif or script) in classic red and blue \"ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR\", featuring a delightful illustration like a stylized sheaf of wheat or a cheerful baker character. In smaller bold print at the bottom of the package: \"NET WT 5 LBS (80 OZ) 2.27kg\". Focus sharply on the package details – the slightly soft edges of the paper bag, the texture of the vintage printing, the inviting \"All-Purpose Flour\" text. Subtle hints of the 1960s kitchen frame the shot – the chrome edge of the counter gleaming softly, a blurred glimpse of a pastel yellow ceramic tile backsplash, or the corner of a vintage metal canister set just out of focus. The shallow depth of field keeps attention locked on the beautifully designed package, creating an aesthetic rich in warmth, authenticity, and nostalgic appeal."
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
2. Authentication
#
The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key
#
In case your app is running in an environment where you cannot set environment variables, you can set the API Key manually as a client configuration.

import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

fal.config({
  credentials: "YOUR_FAL_KEY"
});
Protect your API Key
When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information, check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue
#
Long-running requests
For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request
#
The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the model.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const { request_id } = await fal.queue.submit("fal-ai/imagen4/preview", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Capture an intimate close-up bathed in warm, soft, late-afternoon sunlight filtering into a quintessential 1960s kitchen. The focal point is a charmingly designed vintage package of all-purpose flour, resting invitingly on a speckled Formica countertop.

  },
  webhookUrl: "https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
});
Fetch request status
#
You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or still in progress.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const status = await fal.queue.status("fal-ai/imagen4/preview", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b",
  logs: true,
});
Get the result
#
Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output Schema for the expected result format.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.queue.result("fal-ai/imagen4/preview", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b"
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
4. Files
#
Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)
#
You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)
#
You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests, rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files
#
We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client API and use the returned URL in your requests.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const file = new File(["Hello, World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const url = await fal.storage.upload(file);
Auto uploads
The client will auto-upload the file for you if you pass a binary object (e.g. File, Data).

Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.
